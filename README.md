# Global ancestry models for worldwide human population

## Description
The collection holds various models of global worldwide ancestry (with the number of ancestral components ranging from K=6 up to K=28), which can be easily integrated into separate project as pre-maid reference panels for *4* standard programs for : **[iAdmix](https://bansal-lab.github.io/software/iadmix.html), [SNPWEIGHTS](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/), [fastNGSadmix](http://www.popgen.dk/software/index.php/FastNGSadmix) and [ancestry](https://bitbucket.org/joepickrell/ancestry)**

> **Note:** It is highly advisable to consult manuals and user guides to learn best practices of using each of aforementioned programs.

- **iAdmix** is a program to estimate individual admixture proportions from DNA sequencing experiments (exome sequencing, targeted sequencing, low coverage whole-genome sequencing or genotyping
- **SNPweights** is a software package for inferring genome-wide genetic ancestry using SNP weights precomputed from large external reference panels
- **fastNGSadmix** is a tool to fast and reliably estimate admixture proportions and perform PCA from next generation sequencing data of a single individual. The analyses are based on genotype likelihoods of the input sample (in BEAGLE) and a set of predefined reference populations. The method has high accuracy, even at low sequencing depth and corrects for the biases introduced by small reference populations.
